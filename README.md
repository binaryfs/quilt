# Quilt
The Quilt library offers a simple way to use 9-patch images in the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) framework.

![Quilt demo screenshot](assets/demoscreen.png?raw=true)

The primary aim behind creating this library was to provide 9-patch images that can be easily transformed and seamlessly loaded from an image atlas.

Quilt achieves this functionality by using meshes to represent 9-patch images. These meshes are structured in the following way:

     1    2    3    4
     ┌────┬────┬────┐
     │  / │  / │  / │
     5 /  6 /  7 /  8
     ├────┼────┼────┤
     │  / │  / │  / │
     9 / 10 / 11 / 12
     ├────┼────┼────┤
     │  / │  / │  / │
    13 / 14 / 15 / 16
     └────┴────┴────┘

The nine patches shown above have the following properties:
* The top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right patches each have a static width and height
* The top and bottom patches can stretch horizontally
* The left and right patches can stretch vertically
* The patch in the middle can stretch in all directions

## Requirements

Quilt requires LÖVE 11.x and has no other external dependencies.

## Integration

This section describes how to integrate Quilt into your project.

### Manually

Create a new subdirectory `libs/quilt` in your project root and paste the content of this repository into it. Afterwards you can include Quilt like this:

```lua
local quilt = require("libs.quilt")
```

### Git Submodule

Run the following command in your project root to add quilt as a submodule:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/binaryfs/quilt.git libs/quilt
```

Afterwards you can include quilt like this:

```lua
local quilt = require("libs.quilt")
```

## Usage

### Basic example

```lua
local quilt = require("libs.quilt")

local np

function love.load()
  np = quilt.newNinePatch(
    love.graphics.newImage("assets/texture.png"),
    10,  -- X position of 9-patch on texture
    10,  -- Y position of 9-patch on texture
    100, -- Width of 9-patch on texture
    100, -- Height of 9-patch on texture
    20,  -- Height of top row (margin-top)
    20,  -- Width of right column (margin-right)
    20,  -- Height of bottom row (margin-bottom)
    20   -- Width of left column (margin-left)
  )

  np:setSize(200, 300)
end

function love.draw()
  -- The draw method takes the same arguments as love.graphics.draw.
  np:draw(400, 500)
end
```

The `quilt.newNinePatch` function (which was used in the code above) is a convenience function that aims to provide a LÖVE-like API. If you don't like it, you can use the `NinePatch.new` constructor instead:

```lua
local image = love.graphics.newImage("assets/texture.png")
-- Same parameters as for quilt.newNinePatch
local np = quilt.NinePatch.new(image, 10, 10, 100, 100, 20, 20, 20, 20)
```

And if you prefer named parameters, have a look at the `NinePatch.fromOptions` constructor:

```lua
local np = quilt.NinePatch.fromOptions{
  texture = love.graphics.newImage("assets/texture.png"),
  x = 10,
  y = 10,
  width = 100,
  height = 100,
  marginTop = 20,
  marginRight = 20,
  marginBottom = 20,
  marginLeft = 20,
}
```

### Modifying the mesh

Use the `NinePatch:setSize` method to change the size of a 9-patch. Please note that a 9-patch cannot be smaller than its minimum size, which is the sum of its horizontal and vertical margins.

```lua
local npatch = quilt.newNinePatch(image, 0, 0, 100, 100, 2, 4, 8, 16)

npatch:setSize(200, 100)

-- You can also set width and height separately
npatch:setWidth(200):setHeight(100)

npatch:getMinSize() --> 10, 20
```

You can tint a 9-patch with the `NinePatch:setColor` method:

```lua
-- Tint it red
npatch:setColor(1, 0, 0)

-- You can also pass a color table
npatch:setColor({1, 1, 1, 0.5})
```

If you need even more control (and know what you're doing), you can still get the underlying mesh with the `NinePatch:getMesh` method and modify it yourself:

```lua
local COLOR_INDEX = 3
local npatch = quilt.newNinePatch(...)
local mesh = npatch:getMesh()

for vertex = 1, mesh:getVertextCount() do
  mesh:setVertexAttribute(vertex, COLOR_INDEX, getRandomColor())
end

-- You can also draw the mesh directly
love.graphics.draw(mesh, 10, 20)
```

## Demo

Clone this repository and run it with LÖVE to start the demo.

If you want to run the unit tests, download [lovecase 4](https://github.com/binaryfs/lovecase) and copy the files into the subdirectory `libs/lovecase`. When you start the LÖVE demo, the unit tests are run automatically.
